# My app

## Process

I created a page allowing the impersonation of a user. Then I added the list of conversations of the selected user. I used the Semantic-Ui library because I know it very well and I didn't have time to devote to making another one work or doing css.

I have set up services with Axios to facilitate calls to the server.
I also set up a store with Redux for communication between components. My configuration is really very simple but it could allow the storage of messages to make conversations more fluid for example.

# ToDo

- Tests : I have never had the opportunity to set up tests on a Front-end application, I ask that you learn this part, which I know very well on the Back-end side.
- Error handling : Add a toast or a message when trapping errors with axios. Add a custom page for routing errors.
- Add chat with new user.

# Context :

At leboncoin, our users can share messages about a transaction, or ask for informations about any products.

Your job is to create the interface to consult those messages.
The interface needs to work on both desktop & mobile devices.

In addition to your code, a README explaining your thought process and your choices would be appreciated.

# Exercice :

- Display a list of all the conversations
- Allow the user to select a conversation
  - Inside the conversation, there is a list of all the messages between these two users.
  - As a user, you can type and send new messages in this conversation

**As your application can be used by millions of users, make sure to provide some robust safety guards.**

### Sketches :

Obvisouly, it is up to you to make something nice and pretty, you are free to design it the way you like. The sketches are here to give you an idea on how it should look.

## Bonus 1 :

We provide some conversation samples, but can you improve the app so the user can now create new conversations ?

## Bonus 2 :

Our infrastructure is a bit shaky.. Sometimes the servers are crashing. “It’s not you, it’s me”, but maybe you can display something nice to warn the user and handle it gracefully.

## Do you want to make the app even better ?

Feel free to make as many improvements as you like.
We love creativity and technical challenges.

If you are out of ideas, here are some thoughts :

- As we want to reach our users anywhere, we need to make sure the app is performing well. What can you do to make it really fast ?

- Our goal is to support everybody in the country, including people with disabilities. As a good citizen and a good developer, can you make sure the app is accessible for everyone ?

- We all love to relax after a hard day’s work. It would be a shame if we didn’t feel confident enough about the upcoming automatic deployment. Are you sure everything has been tested thoroughly ?
